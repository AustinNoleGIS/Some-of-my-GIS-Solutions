This script is an example of how GIS Analysts and Developers like myself can
'automate the small stuff' when it comes to certain workflows, like when needinf to move data.
Here, I am pulling spatial data out from my city's/organization's spatial database environment 
and pushing it into my ArcGIS Pro project where I may explore it and conduct further analysis on it,
all by using just a few lines of code.

arcpy.management.MakeFeatureLayer( r“my_FeatureClass_full_pathway_in_the_City_SDE”
, “my_new_output_layer’s_title”
, ‘’
, r”full_pathway_of_my_City_SDE”
, “{field_info}”
)

<Result 'CityLimits_Layer' added to my map>
