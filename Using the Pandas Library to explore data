# The Pandas library is used in python scripts for basic data analysis and data editing tasks.
# I can use Pandas either inside ArcGIS Pro's built-in Python window or inside the software's Jupyter
# Notebook window. Great for giving me a surface-level view of my data before working with it.
# I can take tabular data (spatial or non-spatial) and use Pandas to add it to its own Pandas 
# Data Frame. From there, I can filter, aggregate, and transform that data however I please - great
# for cleaning and preparing a feature's attribute data before conducting any spatial analysis on it.

# Import the Pandas library.
import pandas as pd

# Assign a .csv document to a variable.
csvTable = pd.read_csv( r"my_csv's_full_pathway )

# Preview the .csv data in my Jupyter Notebook window.
csvTable.head()

# Learn about my data's columns
csvTable.info()

# Examine my data's basic statistical properties
csvTable.describe()

# Statistically analyze the properties of one single column from my data
csvTable[ 'column_name' ].describe()

# Identify the Mean of one single column
csvTable[ 'column_name' ].mean()

# Identify the Median of one single column
csvTable[ 'column_name' ].median()
